title: "What happens outside of the project folder?"
---

So far, we've focused on how the Project Folder is set up to help you go from data to final product. However, there's a lot of work that goes into a project **before** you have any data. In particular, you will need to have a thorough grasp of the published literature, a well-organized plan for data collection and management, and some way to keep track of what you've done. The project folder can help with some aspects of this. For example, funded grant applications, relevant protocols and data management plans, naming conventions, etc. can all be kept together with a project in the Background directory. I've found, however, that doing some of this work outside the project folder allows you to access a more centralized network of systems that can provide richer, more robust insights.

I've outlined my workflow in schematic form here, and describe some of the key tenets below. Before going any further, know that the workflow described is going to be highly individual - this is something that I've found works for me. You might benefit from something similar, or something completely different. Explore the (many) options out there!

# Work flow priorities

A major part of research is reading literature. For better or worse, each day sees a flood of new papers published across any number of scientific journals. This is where the day-to-day workflow starts for me. You need some system for capturing, sorting, organizing, and annotating these papers. Ideally, your system will also help you to make connections between key points gleaned from these papers. Each of those steps (capturing, sorting, organizing, annotating, and synthesizing) are the focus of myriad programs, tools, approaches, and philosophies.

Before you dive into everything that's out there, though, spend some time thinking about how you work, and what elements would actually help you get stuff done. Do you want something that is simple and streamlined? Or do you like things with all the bells and whistles, that allows you to customize things to your liking? How much time per day do you intend on spending on each of these steps? Be realistic here - there's no point in setting up a system that requires a little time each day to work if you know you'd prefer to spend more time at less frequent intervals.

My personal workflow emphasizes five things:

**Quick capture** - I need to be able to quickly flag a paper, data set, protocol, news article, etc. when I see it. The key here is being able to grab anything and everything I see that might be relevant to past, present, or future work. I rely on a combination of Google Scholar and Web of Science alerts for general topics of interest, authors, and citations to certain key papers; social media; and more targeted, project-specific literature searches to collect (potentially) relevant papers. [ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai) is also worth playing around with - while it's still a fairly new tool, it seems to be a nice complement (although not replacement) for traditional search tools.

Because I'm prioritizing speed of capture, all of these resources are sent to a single 'inbox'. I use a page in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/desktop) for this, since there's a nice web clipper tool for this app that I can use on both my phone and computer. Once or twice a week, I'll sit down and sort through the inbox. Not everything ends up being relevant or useful, but since it's quick and easy to capture things, I don't mind having to screen extra stuff in order to be more confident that I'm not missing important papers.

**A robust centralized organization** - After collecting all these resources, I need a robust system to organize everything. I'll eventually have to find them when they're needed. This can be especially tricky with resources that are relevant (or might be relevant) for future projects. I also prefer that these systems be 'centralized' (i.e. - one collection of resources accessed for multiple projects, rather than an individual, independent collection for each project). This helps me cut down on redundancy when a resource might be relevant to more than one project.

When sorting through the inbox, non-paper resources (data sets, tutorials, etc.) are screened out and organized in a series of topic-based pages in Notion. There's also a separate page where I keep track of preprints that look promising but haven't been published yet. This leaves published papers, which are screened for relevance, utility, interest, etc.

Papers I want to store for later use are sent to [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org), again using a helpful web clipper tool. I prefer Zotero over some of the other major reference managers because it's open source and developed by a non-profit organization. Once a paper is in my Zotero library, I'll assign it to one or more folders for specific topics or projects. This strategy seems to hit the right balance for me between project-level organization of papers and keeping things centralized.

**Easy annotation** - I know that I am really vulnerable to the [collector's fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/) (the notion that gathering information is the same as learning the information). I also know that I'm less likely to read something in a timely manner with more complex workflows. That being said, I want the effort that goes into reading a paper to "pay off"; specifically, I want be able to easily find the notes that I took when I return to a paper, rather than having to re-read the entire thing over again. I lose handwritten notes too easily, and I get too distracted by one long word document / excel file of notes. My solution is to keep notes and annotations stored alongside the PDFs of the papers. Zotero (version 6 and onward) includes an excellent PDF reader that I use to read and annotate papers. The notes you take on the PDF can be quickly pulled into Zotero as a note attached to the reference entry. This keeps the bibliographic information, PDF, and notes all together in the same place.

**Making connections across resources** - Some of the most interesting ideas stem from connections between two seemingly unrelated topics. I like my workflow to not only allow for those types of connections, but to promote them. I pull heavily from the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) method to make notes on what I read. I encourage you to explore this method a bit if you're interested in thinking about how you take notes.

Regardless of the method used to take notes, you will need to keep the notes you take organized. Much like how RStudio helps you work in R, Obsidian is a text editing environment that helps you work with markdown text files, which I use to collect and organize my notes. This is aided by a nice integration between Zotero and Obsidian that pulls the annotation notes into markdown files. Because all notes for all projects are kept in the same place, it's easier to see patterns and make connections, often across project/topic boundaries.

I also use Obsidian as a digital lab notebook. The ability to use templates makes things like setting up experiments, recording the health of cultures, and keeping track of daily activities a little easier. And because it uses markdown files, you don't have to worry about not being able to access data across systems.

**Integration** - There's no single perfect app that does everything I want to aid my workflow. I also don't want to be reliant on a bunch of different apps and software (I know I am too easily distracted by the grandeur of these complex workflows to get any actual work done with them). Over time I've settled on the workflow described here, which relies on just a couple, relatively streamlined programs that integrate nicely with each other. Additionally, while relying on centralized systems, there's no barriers to the flow of information and insight from outside to inside the project folders. For me, this is the most important aspect; to be able to go from a broad, centralized network of resources to highly specific application in individual projects.

Remember, the system I've outlined here is what works for me. Everyone works in different ways though. You can take the components (if any) that work for you and then explore your other options to fill in the gaps in your workflow. Keep in mind that this workflow is a major part of how you interface with the scientific world; Try to find something that helps you feel excited about the material you're working with! This will probably be an iterative process. You might not land on something right away. But as you learn more (and learn more about how you learn best), the features and priorities of an ideal personal workflow will solidify.
