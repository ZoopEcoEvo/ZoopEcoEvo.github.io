# Another Benefit of the Project Folder

Project folders are also set up to help integrate figures, statistical results, etc. into the manuscript writing process. By keeping all relevant files in the same project folder, and using the controller script to weave different components together, it should be easier to write (and then update) a manuscript draft with the correct results. For example, smart usage of inline code will save you from having to manually update statistical results in tables and text throughout the draft when changes are made (saving time and helping to avoid confusion down the road!). And by using the files in the Output directory to place figures, the manuscript should always be pulling from up-to-date visualizations.

There should be a directory entitled "Manuscript" within each project folder, which includes a .Rmd file (the manuscript file), a .docx file (the template document used when knitting to a word file), a .tex file (the formatting and style details for the PDF document produced) and a .bib file (containing the bibliography). By default, these will produce nicely formatted PDF and word documents when the .Rmd file is knit (via the controller script). This is different from the report .Rmd file (which by default outputs an HTML and special markdown file) - the main difference here is that code chunks will not appear in the PDF or word documents, while they do in the HTML and markdown outputs. In order to ensure the correct file paths, it is important that the manuscript markdown file be knit using the render() code in the controller script.

# Getting Started

Before you start writing the first draft, rename the .Rmd file name to reflect the manuscript. Typically we will format the file name as it would be referred to in an in-text citation (ex - LeadAuthor_et_al_2022, Author1_and_Author2_2022, etc.). If you've got multiple files with the same name (meaning multiple papers per project - nice job!), you can append letters to the name (LeadAuthor_et_al_2022a, LeadAuthor_et_al_2022b, etc.) or add a little context (LeadAuthor_et_al_2022_plasticity, LeadAuthor_et_al_2022_latitudinal, etc.).

Keep the use of code within the manuscript .Rmd file to a minimum. All major data analysis and figure generation should be performed in other scripts within the project folder. When placing figures, for example, it will be substantially faster to use the image files output by the Report.Rmd file than to create the figures from code. Given the number of times you'll likely knit a manuscript during the writing and revision process, this saved time adds up. It is therefore in your best interest to ensure that the report.Rmd file (or whichever script is outputting the image files) reflects publication-ready figures whenever possible.

The use of a reference manager is strongly recommended. RStudio has a built in citation function, but the ability to store and organize references outside of the project is also useful. [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) is an open source reference manager that integrates nicely with RStudio and markdown documents. This is the program I use/recommend. There's a useful write up of how citations work in .Rmd files [here](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-1-4-preview-citations/). Note, you'll need to be using RStudio version 1.4 or later to access these features.

Keep in mind that citations are contained within square brackets rather than parentheses, and should be separated by semi-colons rather than commas. This will produce a citation in the format of (Author1 et al., YEAR; Author2 et al., YEAR). For citations like "... as shown by Author1 and Author2 (YEAR)...", the square brackets are omitted. 

# Getting Feedback

The workflow for writing the manuscript draft will be similar to that used during the Project Development phase, at least while putting together the initial versions. Changes are made on a working branch, which are reviewed via Pull Request. The PR interface works well for providing comments, but not the sort of line editing that is common during the manuscript writing process. We'll use the PR to make general comments, but specific edits might also be made directly on the .Rmd file. These changes will be made on your working branch, so to review the changes you'll just have to remember to pull the updates onto your local machine. We'll likely repeat this PR-comments-edits-pull cycle several times before accepting and merging the manuscript draft into the main branch.

If comments are required from co-authors who do not use GitHub, it is the responsibility of the lead author to ensure they are sent an up-to-date word document (or Google Doc version) and that their comments are properly integrated into the GitHub repo.

As you approach the submission stage (the manuscript draft is completed and just being polished now), it's time to start thinking about how the data and scripts will be shared with people **outside** our group. One easy approach is to archive the GitHub repo with Zenodo. This allows you designate a Version of Record, which has an associated DOI. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content) for more details.

Once the new repo DOI is included in a Data Availability statement in the manuscript, it's ready for submission. The .Rmd file is knit and the resulting PDF and word documents are prepared for submission to a preprint server and journal, respectively.

During peer review, a manuscript will be read and evaluated by several reviewers who will give (varying amounts of) feedback. Once you get these reviews, you can start a new working branch for a second version of the manuscript and start making the recommended changes. Here again the benefits of using a project folder are evident - depending on the feedback you might have to make changes to the analyses or figures, which will be automatically incorporated into the manuscript (at least where file paths and inline code are used).

# Post-publication

The general static nature of published work in the current body of scientific literature creates many issues. The Github repository for each project is a "live" entity, that can overcome some of these issues by serving as a central source for corrections, updates, and expansions of the manuscript after publication. This approach is outlined in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0463), which integrates seamlessly with our workflow.
