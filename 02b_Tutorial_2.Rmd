Hopefully you're now familiar with the basic syntax of R and the structure of common data objects. As we saw in the first tutorial, both are important when manipulating data in what might seem like simple ways (e.g. - subsetting rows or columns in a dataframe). This section of the tutorial will further develop your ability to manipulate and analyze data using slightly more complicated code structures.

# rbind() and cbind()

Even when you're importing data files from excel or .csv files, you may need to combine data objects in R during an analysis. There are two straightforward ways to do this using base R; rbind() and cbind(). These stand for "Row Bind" and "Column Bind" respectively. They're perhaps best illustrated when trying to add a vector to an array or data frame. In the example below, the function rbind() will bind the vector to the data frame as a new row, while cbind() will bind the vector to the data frame as a new column. Note that the new column takes on the variable names as a column name.

```{r}
#Note that our vector is length 7, and that the array is a 7 x 7 grid
vector = c(3,3,3,3,3,3,3)
df = data.frame(matrix(nrow = 7, ncol = 7)) 

#Attaching vector as new row
rbind(df, vector)

#Attaching vector as new column
cbind(df, vector)
```

These commands work for binding arrays/dataframes to other arrays/dataframes too.

```{r}
df1 = data.frame(matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 4, data = 1))
df2 = data.frame(matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 4, data = 2))

rbind(df1, df2)

cbind(df1, df2)
```

You might notice that when cbinding these two data frames, the resulting object has **duplicate** column names. This is absolutely an issue. When rbinding data frames, they must have the same column names, in the same order, otherwise R will not allow the objects to be joined (we will cover more flexible strategies for binding rows in a later tutorial). However, when cbinding data frames, it's important to make sure that the columns either have different names before binding, or are renamed after binding, to prevent confusion or interference with later analyses. Re-naming columns has a slightly different syntax from anything we've done so far.

```{r error = T}
colnames(df1) = c("col1", "col2", "col3", "col4")

rbind(df1, df2)

cbind(df1, df2)
```

You can also use a vector to store and assign column names.

```{r}
names_for_columns = c("A", "B", "C", "D")

colnames(df2) = names_for_columns

cbind(df1, df2)
```

# Summarizing data frames with table()

When dealing with categorical or non-numeric data, it can sometimes be useful to summarize the contents of a data object in table format. The table() function provides counts for each of the different categories or factors contained within a column.

```{r}
#Manually creating a data frame that contains information for five cats
cat_data = data.frame(name = c("MrWhiskers", "CatStevens", "ChairmanMeow", 
                               "FuzzAldrin", "UmaPurrman"), 
                      colour = c("black", "orange", "tabby", "tabby", "black"))

#Summarize the contents of the table by colour
table(cat_data$colour)
```

You now know that there are two black cats, one orange cat, and two tabbies in the data frame. Now let's say you wanted to print the names of the different cats in each colour category. For a small data frame like this, it's probably not necessary to manipulate anything and you could just print the dataframe to get the information you need. But when data frames contain hundreds or thousands of observations, it's impractical to try to get the information you need just by reading through the unaltered object. We've covered how to use logical statements to subset data frames already, and you could use this approach to identify which cats have which coloration. Make sure you are comfortable with the subsets performed below.

```{r}
black_cats = cat_data[cat_data$colour == "black",]
black_cats$name

orange_cats = cat_data[cat_data$colour == "orange",]
orange_cats$name

tabby_cats = cat_data[cat_data$colour == "tabby",]
tabby_cats$name
```

This strategy basically copies, pastes, and slightly alters code for each category. When dealing with small numbers of categories, this is manageable (if a little inefficient), but what if you have twenty categories? A hundred? It rapidly becomes infeasible to replicate code for large numbers of categories. To solve this issue, we use a code structure called a ""for loop"".

# The *for loop*

A "for loop" is a simple way to run the same chunk of code many times on different data, without having to copy, paste, and modify the code. As such, the "for loop" is often essential for keeping code manageable. A "for loop" has two components, the "for" statement, and the "code chunk". The code chunk is the code you want to run. While this is of course an important component of the "for loop", the for statement is what's really at the heart of this coding structure. The for statement simply establishes a variable and controls its identity. In the example below, the for statement is saying that there is some variable 'i', which is going to cycle through values from 1 to 10. The code chunk will then iterate, or repeat, with each of those different values assigned to i. These two different components follow a set syntax of for(statement){code_chunk}, but it's common to see the code chunk split across multiple lines, with the first curly bracket following the for statement, and the code itself below that.

```{r}
for(i in 1:10){
  print(i)
}
```

The trick with "for loops" is figuring out how to write the code chunk to use the variable instead of fixed values to accomplish your goal. It's important to note that each iteration is independent; what happens in one iteration doesn't get carried forward to the next iterations (automatically). Going back to our feline dilemma, we still want to know the names of the different cats that have each type of coloration. A common approach for using "for loops" to analyze data in this way is to start off by identifying all of the unique groups, and then using a "for loop" to cycle through each one to analyze the data. Look through the example below. Try to figure out what each line of code is doing, and how the "for loop" structure produces the printed results. A commented version is included afterwards if you get stuck.

```{r}
cat_colours = unique(cat_data$colour)

for(c in 1:length(cat_colours)){
  subset = cat_data[cat_data$colour == cat_colours[c],]
  print(c(cat_colours[c], subset$name))
}
```

```{r}
#Identifies and stores all of the unique cat colours contained in the data frame
cat_colours = unique(cat_data$colour)

#For all values of c between 1 and the length of the cat_colours vector 
#(i.e. - the number of different unique colours)
for(c in 1:length(cat_colours)){
  #Subset the data to include just one of colours 
  #(specified as position c in the cat_colour vector)
  subset = cat_data[cat_data$colour == cat_colours[c],]
  #From that subset, print the colour in question and all the names of cats of that colour 
  print(c(cat_colours[c], subset$name))
}
```

There are endless ways to use a "for loop" in data analysis and manipulation, limited only by your creativity. Some of the more common modifications to a "for loop" are illustrated below.

## Modifying the for statement

For statements are fairly flexible, despite (or maybe because of) their simplicity. You can use any variable name, for example. You can also modify the values the variable will take on - this component of the for statement is essentially just a vector of values; any vector can be used to determine the variable values the loop will cycle through.

```{r}
for(variable in 3:7){
  print(variable)
}
```

```{r}
for(a in seq(from = 3, to = 10, by = 2)){
  print(a)
}
```

```{r}
sentence = c("this", "vector", "contains", "text")
for(word in sentence){
  print(word)
}
```

### The counter

In some cases, you'll want to keep track of how many iterations you've gone through, or the sum of values you've processed. To do this, we use a code object called a counter. Remember, each iteration is independent of the others - Any variables you assign **inside** the code chunk get reset at the beginning of the next iteration when the "for loop" runs the code chunk again. To keep track of the number of iterations or the sum of values though, you need to retain this information somehow. To get around this, you set the variable's initial value **before** the "for loop". Compare the output of the two examples below. Why are they producing different outputs?

```{r}
for(i in 1:10){
  a = 0
  a = a + i
  print(a)
}
```

```{r}
b = 0
for(i in 1:10){
  b = b + i
  print(b)
}
```

The second example sums up all the values of i used in the "for loop", using this counter object to "protect" the value from the iterative resets. Counters, as their name implies, are also used to count iterations. In the example below, the value of the counter goes up by one during each iteration. After the "for loop" has run through all of its iterations, printing the counter confirms that there were 10 iterations run.

```{r}
counter = 0
for(i in 1:10){
  counter = counter + 1
}

print(counter)

#note that in this specific instance the same 
#information can be retrieved by printing i
print(i)
```

In this simple case, you can get the same information by printing the variable 'i', but these counters can be useful as you get into more complex "for loop" structures. For example, what happens if we have a **nested for loop**? This refers to a "for loop" inside a "for loop". For every individual iteration of the outside loop, the inside loop runs to completion.

```{r}
counter = 0
for(i in 1:3){
  for(j in 1:4){
    print(c(i,j))
    counter = counter + 1
  }
}

print(c(i, j, counter))
```

In this case, the number of iterations is different from the final values of either of the two variables. You can still simply take the product of the two final variable values to get the number of iterations, but in many cases, more complex "for loops" have maximum variable values that change across iterations, making this much more difficult. In those cases, the counter structure is the best option. Can you think of one of the weaknesses of a counter structure? What happens if you run the "for loop" multiple times without resetting the counter?

Counters are also commonly used to count the occurrence of specific types or values of data (often referred to as a 'flag' instead of a counter in these cases). Again, oftentimes this data can be retrieved using something like table() or a logical subset, but as you get into more complex analyses and code, running a flag within or alongside another process can sometimes be useful.

```{r}
tabbies = 0
for(i in 1:length(cat_data$colour)){
  if(cat_data$colour[i] == "tabby"){
    tabbies = tabbies + 1
  }
}

print(tabbies)
```

The above example also introduces the final code structure we'll be covering in this portion of the tutorial: the if / else statement.

# If / Else statements

Much like the "for loop", if / else statements are a technique to help automate or simplify coding. If / else statements rely on the fulfillment of a logical statement to determine what to do. Because these statements have two outcomes (True or False), these statements are essentially ways to encode binary decision making into your analysis.

```{r}
#For all values of j between 1 and 7...
for(j in 1:7){
  
  #if the value of j is equal to 5...
  if(j == 5){
    #then print the value of j
    print(j)
    #otherwise...
  }else{
    #print this message
    print("this value does not equal 5")
  }
}
```

If you don't provide an alternative code using the else{} component, R will continue on without doing anything.

```{r}
#For all values of j between 1 and 10...
for(j in 1:10){
  
  #if the value of j is equal to 5...
  if(j == 5){
    #then print the value of j
    print(j)
  }
}
```

As with "for loops", if / else statements can be used in many ways during analyses. Understanding the basic syntax of these more complex coding structures should be enough for you to modify them to fit your needs.

# While Statements

Both for loops and if/else statements tend to be fairly concrete in terms of number of iterations or operations. But what can you do if you want to run an operation until a certain condition is satisfied? Without knowing ahead of time how many operations are needed, a for loop may not be useful or efficient. An if/else statement will do different things based on the current status, but won't reiterate automatically. The while statement allows you to set a condition, and then run a chunk of code until that condition is satisfied. Be careful, however, to ensure that the code chunk will eventually satisfy the stated condition, otherwise the while statement will keep running forever.

```{r}
c = 1 
while(c < 10){
  print(paste("c is equal to ", c,". ", "This values of c is still too small", sep = ""))
  c = c + 1
  #d = d + 1    Replacing the above line with this would result in a while statement that runs forever.
}
```

A simple manual solution is to set limits on the number of iterations the while statement will run. This can be done using the counter objects we described above. In the example below, the operation stops after 100 iterations, even if the main condition (that c exceeds 10) is not met.

```{r}
c = 1 
d = 1
counter = 0

while(c < 10 & counter < 100){
  d = d + 1
  counter = counter + 1
}

print(counter)
```

This is the end of the second tutorial. We have covered a lot of the basics of using R to manipulate and examine data. You should now be able to import data from an external file, examine the structure of the data, describe basic qualities (like the mean and maximum values), and subset the data. Using "for loops", if/else statements, and while statements, you should also be able to start piecing together more complex processes These are the fundamental building blocks to performing analyses in R. Much of this uses "Base R" - the collection of functions and capabilities that come pre-loaded. As we move through the remaining tutorials, we will supplement (and sometimes replace) what we have already covered with more streamlined, sophisticated, or useful techniques and functions. As with any skill though, you should master the basics first.
